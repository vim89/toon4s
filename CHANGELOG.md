- feat: add line/column info to decode errors

  Add ErrorLocation case class with line, column, and snippet fields.
  Update DecodeError trait to include optional location parameter.
  Modify Scanner to include location in tab/indentation errors.
  Update Decoders to include location in list item format errors.
